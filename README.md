# draw-image-through-cv2

OpenCV allows a user to create a wide variety of shapes, including rectangles, squares, circles, etc.

Below we have provided the arguments the function takes. Then we show example code that draws different shapes on an image.
cv2.circle ( image, center, radius, color of border, line thickness / fill type, line type)
cv2.rectangle ( image, upper left corner vertex, lower right corner vertex, line thickness / fill type, line type))
Thickness :-
The thickness of the boundary is controlled by the thickness parameter. By default, only an outline of the shape is drawn. To draw a shape that is filled with the specified color, the thickness should be -1.
The lineType parameter controls the quality of rendering.
